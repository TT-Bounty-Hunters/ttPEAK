# ttPEAK

A synthetic benchmarking tool to measure peak capabilities of Tenstorrent devices. It only measues the peak metrics that can be easily measured and easy to program for. It does not represent the actual performance of the device in real world applications.


## How to build

**This section needs to be cleaned up and provide clearer instructions**

Before building this project. Setup the enviroment variables that Metalium needs

```bash
export ARCH_NAME=grayskull                                                                   
export TT_METAL_HOME=/path/to/your/root/of/tt-metal/
export PYTHONPATH=$TT_METAL_HOME
export TT_METAL_ENV=dev
```

Then build the project

```bash
cd ttPEAK
# HACK: Metalium only searches kernels under it's directories
ln -s ttpeak_kernels $TT_METAL_HOME/ttpeak_kernels

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

To run

```
